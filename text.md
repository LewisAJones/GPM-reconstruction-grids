## Abstract

## Background & Summary

## Methods

## Data records
All five reconstruction files are available via the online [Zenodo]() repository along with the code and Global Plate Models used to generate them. The reconstruction files are stored as comma-seperated files which can be easily read by almost any spreadsheet program (e.g. Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets) or programming language (e.g. Python, Julia, and R). The file structure follows a wide-format dataframe structure to ease indexing with each column representing . Each file consists of three initial index columns relating to the h3 cell index, present-day longitude of the cell centroid and the present-day latitude of the cell centroid. The subsequent columns provide the reconstructed longitudinal and latitudinal coordinate pairs for their respective age of reconstruction in ascending order (e.g. `lng_10`, `lat_10`).
